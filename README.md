# CTF-WITH-HTML-CSS-JAVASCRIPT
Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge, you can use HTML as part of the presentation layer to display challenges, provide instructions, or showcase hints. Here's an example of an HTML-based CTF challenge
In this example, the HTML file (index.html) includes two sections, each representing a CTF challenge. The challenges involve decrypting a message and solving a math puzzle. Participants need to submit their answers using the provided forms.

The CSS file (styles.css) provides some basic styling to format the header, sections, and form elements.

The JavaScript file (script.js) adds event listeners to the challenge forms. It checks the submitted answers against the expected solutions and displays a corresponding result message.

This HTML-based CTF challenge demonstrates a basic interactive experience where participants can enter their answers and receive immediate feedback on whether their submissions are correct or not.

You can extend this example by adding more challenges, incorporating different types of puzzles or tasks, and implementing additional validation or scoring mechanisms as per the requirements of your CTF event.
